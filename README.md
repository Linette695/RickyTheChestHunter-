# Background:
RickyTheChestHunter- is a repo for the development of a casual maze game named "Ricky The Chest Hunter!". This Project was made as an intro project during my undergaraduate career.

The objective of the game was to provide an introduction to 3D game development by using Unity(a video game software development platform).

The Executable file ("cs583S20_Jaimes_Linette_Pro_03.exe") is under the BuiltGame directory.

Controllers: 
          
        * Arrow keys or  [W] [A] [S] [D] to move character
          
        * Mouse to move camera / turn
          
        * Space bar to jump
          
        * [P] to pause
          
          
 --> More Information about the game can be found in the Game Design Document ( pdf file named: Ricky The Chest Hunter GDD ), under Assets/Documentation
